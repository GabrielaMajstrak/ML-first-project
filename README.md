# Overview
This project is part of the course "Introduction to Machine Learning" and focuses on supervised learning, specifically binary classification. The objective of the project is to build a model that can predict whether a client should be granted a loan or not.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and can be found at this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zafish/consumer-loans?select=orig_test.csv). A detailed description of the dataset is available in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb), where all features and their respective descriptions are thoroughly explained.

# Model Validation
The models were validated by an independent team to ensure objectivity and accuracy of the results.
